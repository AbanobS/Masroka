# Masrokahh
Implementation by PHP..

Masrokah is a website that helps someone who lost one of his items or tools to find the founder ( if he has the intention to retrieve them)
HOW ?
The Finder Opens Masrokah and create a post including the category of the missing item , picture and some questions that guarantee that 
just the real owner know them (generated by Masrokaah for each category)
when the one who lost something enters Masrokaah and finds his missing item , he opens the post and answers the questions which were set
if they are correct ; the profile and number of the finder appears and link the two with each other.
